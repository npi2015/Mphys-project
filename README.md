# Mphys project: A blinking ladder to the stars

## Authors: Ignacio Gonzalez-Espejo and Fred Caudwell

The objective of this experiment is to determine the capacity of the bath physics observatory by measuring the distance to certain RR Lyrae type stars and, if possible, other standard candles such as Cepheids. This is a repository to keep track of what we do as we advance through the experiment, serving both as a data and code backup as well as a sort of logbook. We will be adding notes and ideas as we move along, and merging them if they are successful. On a more personal note, I (Ignacio) will be updating this document as we go along with some more information pertaining the coding logic. It is also likely we will be maintaining a theory section, in which the math behind the experiment is outlined in (hopefully) an informal and approachable way.

## Aims and objectives <a name="Aims-and-objectives"></a>
Back to [index](#index)

As outlined earlier, the objective of this experiment is to test the capabilities of the bath physics observatory. In order to do so, there are several things that will need to be looked at. In this section, I will be outlining the different short term objectives, as well as the motivation behind them. I will also be updating them as we move forward with the project, and adding a brief note detailing wether or not they were successful.

Here we will give a brief outline of the explanation used, and provide links to the manufacturer's website and any papers that we consider of high importance to this experiment.

## Theory <a name="Theory"></a>
Back to [index](#index)

In this section, we aim to answer the following questions
* What are RR Lyrae?
* How do they work?
* How do our telescopes work?
* What sort of interferences will we run into? 
* How are we solving it?

Here, I'll be explaining the logic behind the code, and providing references to the packages and functions used. For more detail, please check out the code itself, the notebooks themselves also have explanations.
